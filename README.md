I started by studying technical analysis to understand how traders make decisions and what factors influence their investments. I then learned Python to apply these concepts.

In my first assignment, I analyzed Reliance stock over the past year, identified buy/sell signals, and used three technical indicators. In the next assignment, I coded strategies using Fibonacci retracement, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
